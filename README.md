## ⚙️ High-Level Overview


-User interactions (creating, editing, deleting notes) are handled through an event-driven JavaScript architecture.<br>
-All application data is persisted locally using the browser’s LocalStorage API, ensuring data availability across sessions.<br>
-The user interface is dynamically updated through DOM manipulation, eliminating the need for page reloads.<br>
-Features such as search, tagging, pinning, and theme switching are implemented as independent UI behaviors layered on top of the core state logic.
